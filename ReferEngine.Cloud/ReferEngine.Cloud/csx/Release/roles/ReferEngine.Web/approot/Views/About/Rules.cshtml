                    Refer Engine enables users to submit Recommendations for applications from within these applications and offers them a recommendation reward. These rules apply for submitting a recommendation for @Model.Name for @Model.Platform.
                </p>

                <h4>1. You must agree to the <a href="~/about/terms">Refer Engine Terms of Use</a></h4>
                <p>Users must agree to the <a href="~/about/terms">Refer Engine Terms of Use</a> before submitting a recommendation. Users automatically agree to those terms when using Refer Engine.</p>
                <h4>2. Offer only applys to users who have a valid U.S. Mailing address.</h4>
                <p>For the current version of Refer Engine, we mail rewards checks to users. For now, we are only able to mail reward checks to U.S. Mailing addresses. </p>
                <h4>3. Friends must buy @Model.Name within 2 weeks of your recommendation to be counted towards your credit</h4>
                <p>
                    This promotion runs for 2 weeks after you submit your initial recommendation of @Model.Name on Facebook. Only your first recommendation is considered valid for this promotion. Your friends must purchase the app within 2 weeks of your initial recommendation
                    to be eligible to be counted as credits. For example, when you submit a recommendation of @Model.Name, three of your friends must buy @Model.Name within two weeks of that recommendation for you to win the cash reward. You will be able to submit further recommendations, but 
                    those will not be eligible for the reward. This enables us to "free up" your friends for possible recommendations from their other friends.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Friends must login to Refer Engine from within @Model.Name within 4 weeks of your recommendation to be counted towards your credit</h4>
                <p>The only way for us to properly track that a friend has actually purchased the app is when they login to Refer Engine (using Facebook)
                    from within the application itself.
                </p>
