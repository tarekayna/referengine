Copies one or more files between Azure Storage and a Windows file system.

azcopy source destination [filepattern [filepattern...]] [options]

source                    Specifies the source location to copy from.
                          See Location Specification below.
destination               Specifies the destination location to copy to.
                          See Location Specification below.
filepattern               Specifies one or more file patterns to copy.
                          On a file system source location standard wildcards
                          apply. On an Azure Storage source location 
                          the filepattern is interpreted as a prefix.

Options:
--------
/S                        Recursive copy.
                          In recursive copy mode the source and destination
                          are treated as a directory (file-system) or 
                          as a prefix string (blob storage).
/A                        Copy only files with the Archive attribute set.
/sourceKey:<storage-key>  Provides the storage key for the source
                          (if applicable). If the source location is a 
                          blob storage account, and a key is not provided,
                          then the blob will be read via anonymous access.
/destKey:<storage-key>    Provides the storage key for the destination 
                          (if applicable). If the destination is a blob storage
                          account, then a key must be provided.
/L                        List only: do not copy.
/blobtype:<page|block>    Specifies that the destination is a block blob
                          (block) or a page blob (page).
                          This option is only applicable when the destination
                          is a blob account; otherwise, an error is generated.
                          When using the page blob option, the blob will be
                          zero-padded to a 512-byte boundary.
                          If the destination is a blob account and the blobtype
                          parameter is not specified by default the block blob
                          type will be used.
/V                        Display the transferring status verbosely.
/XN                       Exclude Newer. Don't copy if source file is newer 
                          than destination file.
/XO                       Exclude Older. Don't copy if source file is older
                          than destination file.
/Y                        Suppresses prompting to confirm you want to overwrite
                          an existing destination file.
/Z:[journal-file]         Restartable mode.
                          An empty or non-existent journal-file is used to 
                          maintain a record of the status of the copy operation
                          to allow the operation to restart if interrupted. If 
                          the restartable flag is used without a parameter, the
                          journal-file will default to azcopy.log in the 
                          current working directory.
                          If the journal-file is not empty, it is used for 
                          restarting a previous interrupted copy operation and 
                          will be deleted upon successful completion of the 
                          copy. At this time, the following options will be 
                          checked before transferring: source, destination, 
                          filepattern, /S, /A, /sourceKey, /destKey, /blobtype,
                          /XN, /XO, /Y. These options could be empty in the 
                          restart command. 
/-                        Signal the end of options, cause all remaining 
                          argments to be assigned to the positional parameters.

Location Specification:
-----------------------
A location can be either a locally addressable file location or a URI to a blob
on Azure Storage. Blob URIs always start with either "http://" or "https://".
Any location that does not begin with "http://" or "https://" is treated
as a locally addressable file or directory.
